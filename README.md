My printable CV hand-coded in static HTML & CSS.

Unlike the bad old days of web design, modern CSS provides clever ways to achieve almost any kind of layout through the addition of layout systems like Flexbox, Grid, and CSS custom properties (variables).

Rather than use a design tool to create my CV, I used plain HTML and CSS with print styles to create a mini site that can be easily printed to PDF.

Print styles are notoriously unpredictable, but through a system of fluid measurements facilitated through CSS variables I was able to achieve a layout that not only responds to the digital page width, but print page width as well.
